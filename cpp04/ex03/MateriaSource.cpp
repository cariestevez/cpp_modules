// learnMateria(AMateria*)
// Copies the Materia passed as a parameter and store it in memory so it can be cloned
// later. Like the Character, the MateriaSource can know at most 4 Materias. They
// are not necessarily unique.
// â€¢ createMateria(std::string const &)
// Returns a new Materia. The latter is a copy of the Materia previously learned by
// the MateriaSource whose type equals the one passed as parameter. Returns 0 if
// the type is unknown.
// In a nutshell, your MateriaSource must be able to learn "templates" of Materias to
// create them when needed. Then, you will be able to generate a new Materia using just
// a string that identifies its type.
